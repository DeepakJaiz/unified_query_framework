# unified_query_framework

### Aim

LlamaIndex offers a variety of different query use cases.For simple queries, we may want to use a single index data structure, such as a GPTVectorStoreIndex for semantic search, or GPTListIndex for summarization.For more complex queries, we may want to use a composable graph. <br/>
For more complex queries, we may want to use a composable graph. But how do we integrate indexes and graphs into our LLM application? Different indexes and graphs may be better suited for different types of queries that you may want to run. In this lesson, we show how you can unify the diverse use cases of different index/graph structures under a single query framework
